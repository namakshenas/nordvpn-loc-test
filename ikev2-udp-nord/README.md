# NordVPN IKEv2/udp Test

The servers list can be obtained from here: `https://downloads.nordcdn.com/configs/archives/servers/ovpn.zip`. I extracted them in `servers.json`. All servers receiving pings are stored in `active_servers.json`. 

Note that `root.der` is also required to set `ikev2` on any device.
